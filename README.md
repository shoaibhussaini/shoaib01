Subject: Comfort with Our Framework and Recent WorkDear [Manager's Name],I hope you're doing well. I wanted to let you know about my work with the framework and the projects I've been involved in recently.I've gone through all the automation scripts and feel good about understanding them. I've also been working closely with Rohit every day. Together, we finished the setup for the deployment pipeline.Before joining Rohit's team, I worked on rolling back EKS and was starting to work on rolling back EC2. These projects helped me learn a lot and get more comfortable with our systems.I'm ready to take on more challenges and help our team succeed. Please let me know if there's anything specific you need from me.Thank you for your support.Best,[Your Name]
